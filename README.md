## Assignment 1
The first assignment covers three topics:
1. Data pre-processing and Linear Regression 

2. Neural Networks from scratch 

3. Implementing Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO)

It is an instruction based assessment that covers tuse topics mentioned above as well as the libraries Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn and Matplotlib.
